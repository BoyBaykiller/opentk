\section*{Abstract}
Over the years the OpenTK project has use several different methods for
abstracting platform APIs (such as but not limited to Win32 and X11). The latest
method, the GLFW library has proven to be troublesome and lack the cohesion of
previous PAL of the OpenTK 3.0 Version. This document aims to redesign the
original PAL into C-like interface from which object oriented types may be
derived for all platforms which may be partially implemented depending on the
executing system.
